## Player vs Computer
In this option user lands on the playground screen and can choose one of the displayed option from the screen.
Once user clicks on one of the options (`rock`, `paper`,`scissors`) user is redirected to the game screen where computer randomly selects any of the present option.
For intial purpose we have 3 options enabled `Rock`, `Paper`, `Scissors`. (can be extended in future);
